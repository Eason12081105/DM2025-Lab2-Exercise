study under Master Shifu (Dustin Hoffman) \nBy Claudia Puig, USA TODAY \nThough occasionally visually inventive, Kung Fu Panda is a disappointment when it comes to matters of \nsimple black and white: the script. \nEverything that happens in this dull tale of Po, a paunchy panda who becomes a zealous kung fu fighter, is \ntelegraphed well in advance.  \nMORE: Jack Black tries his hands at kung fu \nPHOTOS: Check out Black's kung fu grip \nThat might not have been a problem had the storytelling been more amusing.  \nThe story centers on the enthusiastic, if clumsy Po (Jack Black), a rabid armchair kung fu fan. Po's day job is \nto work in his family's noodle shop. When he's accidentally chosen as the kung fu master who will fulfill an \nancient prophecy, he must rise to the occasion.  \nDespite the panda being voiced by Black, the humorous moments are few. If you're going to cast someone \nas singularly quirky as Black, then take advantage of his eccentric persona. The role is so straightforward, it \ncould have been played by anyone.  \nAnd the supporting characters—a tiger voiced by Angelina Jolie, a crane played by David Cross, Lucy Liu as \na viper and Jackie Chan as an agile monkey — are so lacking personality that you wonder why the \nfilmmakers bothered to get such a cross section of talent. \nSure, the message to believe in yourself is a valuable, if often-heard, one for young audiences. But it could \nhave played out in a more creative way.  \nPerhaps the most interesting character is Master Shifu, charmingly voiced by Dustin Hoffman. He whips Po \ninto shape and reveals his own character.  \nOne sequence on a swinging wooden bridge is a visual treat, especially when seen in IMAX. But the film's \nclimax doesn't show the fate of the bad guy. This lack of clarity might have more to do with plans for a \nsequel than bad storytelling. \nPerhaps children will be taken by Po's huggable appearance, but anyone older than 9 is likely to be bored.\n\"\"\"\n\n", "document_id": "doc_fdbc54ad"}
